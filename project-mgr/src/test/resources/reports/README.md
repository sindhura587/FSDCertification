### FSD Project Management Case Study ###
--------------------------------------------

Application is to manage the Project and Tasks with the below business functionalities.
To have the new project and task, User needs to be created

	-	 User can view all the existing projects/tasks and also filter the tasks in Frontend. (Backend JPA Filter is defined and not implemented on purpose)

	-   User can add a new project/task with the mandatory fields. Proper validations have been added.

	-   User can edit an existing project/task and also suspend / end the project/task.
	
###  REPORTS ATTACHED ###
--------------------------

1) Sonar Code Analysis and Coverage Reports - Screenshots from the SONAR Dashboard attached.
2) JMeter Load Test Reports:  500 Concurrent Users for 10 mins with real time mySQL DB load test performed and reports attached.
3) Jenkins Build Pipeline:  Jenkins automated build is done and I have attached the build trend screenshots from my client laptop VDI. 
4) ECLEmma Code Coverage Reports:  Seperate reports also attached.
				    

NOTE:  I cannot export the published html jenkins report due to some restrictions. I am using my client VDI to build the project and complete the case study as IIHT Lab is slow for me to perform all work from Netherlands. So attached screenshots from my client machine. 

Already we are running Jenkins in Docker and I have taken screenshots for our case study from Jenkins.
